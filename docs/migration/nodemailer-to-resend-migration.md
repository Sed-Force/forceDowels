# Nodemailer to Resend Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the completed migration from Nodemailer to Resend for all email functionality in the Force Dowels application. The migration was completed to standardize on a single email service provider and improve maintainability.

## Migration Summary

### Before Migration
- **Mixed email implementation**: Some functionality used Resend, others used Nodemailer
- **SMTP configuration**: Required SMTP server credentials and configuration
- **HTML string templates**: Email templates were written as HTML strings
- **Dependency**: `nodemailer` package was required

### After Migration
- **Unified email service**: All email functionality now uses Resend
- **API-based sending**: No SMTP configuration required
- **React Email components**: All email templates are now React components
- **Simplified dependencies**: Only `resend` and `react-email` packages needed

## Files Changed

### 1. `components/email-templates/order-confirmation.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced the existing React Email component to support additional order details
- Added support for shipping and billing addresses
- Added detailed order breakdown with subtotal, shipping, tax, and total
- Added order ID display when available

**New Props Added:**
```typescript
interface OrderConfirmationEmailProps {
  // ... existing props
  subtotal: number;
  shippingCost: number;
  shippingOption: string;
  taxAmount: number;
  taxRate: number;
  shippingInfo: ShippingInfo;
  billingInfo?: BillingInfo;
  stripeSessionId?: string;
}
```

### 2. `app/api/send-email/route.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced Nodemailer imports with Resend
- Removed SMTP transporter configuration
- Replaced HTML string template with React Email component
- Updated email sending logic to use `resend.emails.send()`
- Maintained the same API interface for backward compatibility

**Before:**
```typescript
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({...});
const info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { OrderConfirmationEmail } from '@/components/email-templates/order-confirmation';
const resend = new Resend(RESEND_API_KEY);
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({...});
```

### 3. `package.json`
**Changes Made:**
- Removed `nodemailer` dependency
- Kept existing `resend` and `react-email` dependencies

## Environment Variables

### Removed Variables
The following SMTP-related environment variables are no longer needed:
- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_SECURE`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `SMTP_FROM`

### Required Variables
Only the following email-related environment variable is needed:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Your Resend API key

## Email Functionality Status

### ✅ Migrated to Resend
1. **Order Confirmations** (`lib/email.ts`) - Already using Resend
2. **Admin Order Notifications** (`lib/email.ts`) - Already using Resend
3. **Distributor Applications** (`lib/distributor-email.ts`) - Already using Resend
4. **Customer Order Emails** (`app/api/send-email/route.ts`) - **Newly migrated**

### Email Templates
All email templates are now React Email components:
- `components/email-templates/order-confirmation.tsx` - Customer order confirmations
- `components/email-templates/admin-order-notification.tsx` - Admin notifications
- `emails/distEmailTemplate.tsx` - Distributor applications

## Testing Results

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completed without errors
- ✅ No linting issues
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly

### Development Server
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ Email API endpoints accessible

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Consistency**: All email functionality now uses the same service
2. **Maintainability**: React Email components are easier to maintain than HTML strings
3. **Reliability**: No SMTP configuration issues or server dependencies
4. **Features**: Better deliverability, analytics, and debugging with Resend
5. **Security**: No need to store and manage SMTP credentials
6. **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and preview capabilities with React Email

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured in production
2. **Domain Verification**: Consider verifying your domain with Resend for better deliverability
3. **Email Testing**: Test email functionality in production environment
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for email delivery and bounce rates

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:
1. Reinstall nodemailer: `npm install nodemailer @types/nodemailer`
2. Revert `app/api/send-email/route.ts` to use Nodemailer
3. Configure SMTP environment variables
4. Update email template to use HTML strings

However, this is not recommended as the new implementation is more robust and maintainable.

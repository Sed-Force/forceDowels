# Checkout Page Fixes Summary

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. Shipping Display Messaging
**Problem**: Checkout page showed confusing messaging mixing "LTL shipping" and "UPS shipping" references, with outdated USPS references.

**Solution**: Updated all shipping provider references to clearly distinguish between:
- **UPS shipping** for orders under 20,000 dowels
- **LTL freight shipping via TQL** for orders 20,000+ dowels

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `shippingProvider` state type from `'USPS' | 'TQL'` to `'UPS' | 'TQL'`
- Fixed all conditional messaging to use `'UPS'` instead of `'USPS'`
- Updated shipping method descriptions:
  - UPS: "Standard UPS delivery for orders under 20,000 dowels"
  - TQL: "Professional freight delivery for bulk orders 20,000+ dowels"
- Updated badge colors and carrier display logic
- Fixed shipping method summary in order review

### 2. Cart Quantity Consolidation
**Problem**: Adding multiple Force Dowels quantities created separate line items instead of consolidating into a single item.

**Solution**: Enhanced cart consolidation logic to automatically merge Force Dowels quantities.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `addItem` function in `contexts/cart-context.tsx`
- Added specific logic for Force Dowels consolidation by name (not ID)
- Maintained separate handling for Force Dowels Kit (no consolidation)
- Added console logging for consolidation confirmation
- Preserved existing tier-based pricing recalculation

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Shipping Provider Logic
- **Orders < 20,000 dowels**: âœ… Shows "UPS Shipping" with estimated rates
- **Orders â‰¥ 20,000 dowels**: âœ… Shows "LTL Freight Shipping" with TQL manual quote

### Cart Consolidation
- **Adding 5,000 + 10,000 dowels**: âœ… Results in single 15,000 dowel line item
- **Force Dowels Kit**: âœ… Remains separate, no consolidation
- **Pricing**: âœ… Automatically recalculates to correct tier pricing

## ðŸ“‹ User Experience Improvements

### Clear Shipping Messaging
- **UPS Orders**: Users see clear "UPS Shipping" with estimated delivery times
- **LTL Orders**: Users see "LTL Freight Shipping" with manual quote instructions
- **No Confusion**: Eliminated mixed messaging between shipping methods

### Simplified Cart Management
- **Single Line Item**: Force Dowels quantities automatically consolidate
